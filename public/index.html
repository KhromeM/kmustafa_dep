									<p class="card-text">
										I am in the minority of people who use Youtube Music instead
										of Spotify. One problem with Youtube Music is that music
										from your playlists can unexpectedly disappear if the video
										is removed from Youtube. I was frustrated with this, so I
										decided to create a website that saves the audio of all the
										music from your playlists. It uses OAuth2 to seamlessly
										access a user's playlists, then backs up the audio to an AWS
										S3 bucket. So even when a video from your playlist is
										removed from youtube, you can still play it. In addition, I
										added some functionality to the music player that I felt the
										official youtube music website was lacking, like creating
										randomized playlists using songs from any of your playlists.
										This website has proved useful enough that a few people use
										it every day. <br />
										<br />
										The frontend was built using ReactJS and ChakraUI. There are
										actually two backends. Both are ExpressJS servers. One
										handles the business logic including the OAuth and checking
										for updates to a userâ€™s playlist. The other handles
										downloading audio from Youtube and uploading it to S3. I
										decided to split up the backend in two to make sure the
										server handling the business logic is never under too much
										stress.

									<p class="card-text">
										During my time at Google Computer Science Summer Institute,
										I worked with two other students to develop a real-time
										multiplayer PacMan game that allowed up to four players to
										play the same game of PacMan at once. We used p5.js to paint
										the browser canvas and display the game. Developed hit
										detection, ghosts, power-ups, and a points system. I
										implemented the path-finding algorithm to enable the ghosts
										to find the optimal route to the nearest PacMan using the A*
										algorithm. We enabled multiplayer by using a Firestore
										database to maintain state. The finished game was applauded
										as one of the most technically impressive projects in the
										program.
